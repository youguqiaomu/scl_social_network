stochastic competitive learning：
This is the basic code for stochastic competitive learning！1.xlsx is the data for the code.
data_duibi:
The three suffixes(txt,xlsx,xls) that exist in this folder are not related to the file content. Set n as the name of the social network, and n.edge is the collection of the edges of the social network named n. n.circle is the real community detection result of a social network named n, which is used to verify the accuracy of the results.
One step - output importance order random competitive learning.ipynb:
This file is a python3 code which is the used for the experiment of algorithm improvement based on PSO in the study.
stochastic  competitive learning - experiment - control ability.ipynb:
This file is a python3 file. This code completes the improved experiment of particle domination ability self-Adaptive.
